            Nice to see you space cowboy, you've been out for awhile.<br>
            As you can see we are passing through a bit of space debris. Could you do me a favor?<br>
            I need to do some remapping to our destination. Can you take the wheel?<br>
            I'm sure it's obvious, but if you need me to say it, don't get hit by anything.<br>
            Thanks, just take it slow at first and try not to die.<br>

            This spaceship game was made throughout the month of November 2022<br>
            It features all original visuals and music<br>
            This was my first real project made with JavaScript.<br>
            I would spend roughly an hour on it per day throughout November 2022.<br>
            In total, this project's breakdown was as followed: 7 hours coding<br>
            18 hours learning.<br>
            Learning JavaScript from scratch made this project one of my favorite experiences when it came to
            learning a new programming language.<br>
            I may not be an artist but I am proud to showcase this game as my first JavaScript project.<br>
            While this project is simple, I'd like to revisit the concept in the future and add some levels
            or courses for a player to fly through. I feel as though it would make the game more interesting.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for playing my game!<br>
