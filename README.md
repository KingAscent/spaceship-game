**Scenario**

Nice to see you space cowboy, you've been out for awhile.
As you can see we are passing through a bit of space debris. Could you do me a favor?
I need to do some remapping to our destination. Can you take the wheel?
I'm sure it's obvious, but if you need me to say it, don't get hit by anything.
Thanks, just take it slow at first and try not to die.


**Instructions**

"w"/up arrow - up

"s"/down arrow - down

"a"/left arrow - left

"d"/right arrow - right

"v"/shift key - slow flight


**Project Insight**

This spaceship game was made throughout the month of November 2022
It features all original visuals and music
This was my first real project made with JavaScript.
I would spend roughly an hour on it per day throughout November 2022.
In total, this project's breakdown was as followed: 7 hours coding
18 hours learning.
Learning JavaScript from scratch made this project one of my favorite experiences when it came to learning a new programming language.
I may not be an artist but I am proud to showcase this game as my first JavaScript project.
While this project is simple, I'd like to revisit the concept in the future and add some levels or courses for a player to fly through. I feel as though it would make the game more interesting.


Thank you for playing my game!
